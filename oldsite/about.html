    <h3>Hello!</h3>
    <p><b>[Updated Dec 2019]</b> This is a website where I will be posting various updates related to my ongoing
    bike ride.
    I started riding from S&atilde;o Paulo in January 2019, now it is December
    2019 and I reached Lima in Peru.
    I will be updating this website as I go, the most recent update will appear when the page loads, previous updates can be accessed via the menu at the top left corner.</p>
    <h3>Now it is possible to comment on photos!</h3>
    <p>
    It is now possible to leave me comments about the photos. I look foreword to
    reading them. Partly I wanted to implement this as a personal project to
    learn a bit more about php and mysql. Partly I am interested in what people
    have to say and if anyone is actually interested in my pictures. At the
    moment, it is possible to comment without logging in, just choose a name,
    make it recognisable if you want me to know who you are, there is no kind of
    spam protection. If this causes problems I might have to implement some kind
    of moderation or spam prevention mechanism. We will see.

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
    I am an amateur at website design and while this website looks and works OK on my browser and works but is not quite perfect on my phone, I have no way of knowing if it will work or look as intended on any specific device.
    Feel free to let me know if you spot any glitches or something doesn't look quite right and I will attempt to fix it. </p>
    <h3>Why lt20kmph?</h3>
    <p>
    What a weird name for a website about a bike ride? 
    Well... not really. lt20kmph stands for 'less than 20 kilometers per hour'. 
    This is why travelling by bike is so much fun! 
    Very rarely do you go faster than 20kmph so you see and feel everything. 
    </p>
    <h3>Do you have plans?</h3>
    <p>
    Yes! I will continue to ride my bike for as long as possible.

    About the website? Well I was inspired to make it after many people told me they enjoyed hearing storeys and looking at photos about my trip.
    I have some ideas about other bits and pieces I can add to it (interactive maps to link places to pictures for instance) and as time goes by you might notice some things change.
    At the moment it should be viewed as a work in progress and the main part of the content so far is the pictures. 
    Hopefully future updates will have even nicer pictures since I now have a better camera which was kindly donated to me via some connections of my brother.

    The written content has been written in an incredible rush without much thought and is liable to change, disappear or be added to whenever I feel like I have some more inspiration.
